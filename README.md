# AI Resume analyzer and parser 
Our AI Resume Parser & Analyzer is an intelligent system designed to streamline the recruitment process by automatically extracting, analyzing, and evaluating candidate resumes. Built using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, this tool converts unstructured resume files into structured data, making it easier for recruiters and hiring platforms to assess candidate profiles efficiently.
